# AI Co-Founder with Chain Abstraction

## Description (TL;DR)
Building an AI co founder that takes care of your business/marketing/legal needs with seamless chain abstraction at its core. Seven specialized AI agents work together using Shade Agents running on Phala TEE to handle all business intelligence, while NEAR provides unified chain abstraction so you can operate across any blockchain without managing multiple wallets or networks. Developers get a full business co-founder that works natively across the entire multi-chain ecosystem.

## Problem

### Key Challenges

#### The Technical Co-founder Gap
- Developers excel at product building
- Critical gaps in business development, marketing, legal, and fundraising
- Need for comprehensive business expertise

#### Multi-Chain Complexity
- Managing operations across multiple blockchains
- Different wallets, gas tokens, and protocols per chain
- Fragmented ecosystem limiting business opportunities

#### AI Compute Reliability
- Centralized AI services with downtime risks
- Lack of verifiable AI computation
- No guarantees of execution integrity

#### Cross-Chain Business Operations
- Grant opportunities scattered across different chains
- IP registration on multiple protocols
- Lead generation across diverse ecosystems

## Solution
An AI co founder that operates seamlessly across all chains

### Core Innovation
Our platform leverages NEAR's chain abstraction to provide unified multi-chain operations while Shade Agents on Phala TEE ensure verifiable AI computation:

- Single interface for all blockchain interactions
- Verifiable AI computation via TEE
- Seamless cross-chain business operations
- Unified account abstraction across ecosystems

### Specialized Agent Network
Our system comprises 7 specialized AI agents, each operating across the multi-chain ecosystem:

| Agent | Role | Chain Abstraction Focus |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| Orchestrator | System coordination | Cross-chain workflow management |
| GitHub | Code analysis & repo management | Multi-chain deployment strategies |
| Socials | X/Twitter & Telegram management | Cross-ecosystem audience building |
| Leads | Opportunity discovery | Multi-chain partnership scouting |
| IP | Story Protocol integration | Cross-chain IP protection |
| Grants | Karma.xyz integration | Multi-ecosystem funding discovery |
| Compliance | Competitor monitoring | Cross-chain regulatory tracking |

#### Technical Architecture
All agents run on Shade Agents with Phala TEE for verifiable computation, coordinated through NEAR's chain abstraction layer.

### Technology Stack

| Component | Description |
|-----------|-------------|
| AI Compute | Shade Agents on Phala TEE for verifiable AI execution |
| Chain Abstraction | NEAR protocol for unified multi-chain operations |
| Orchestration | Node.js/Express.js with cross-chain agent coordination |
| Account Abstraction | Single account managing operations across all chains |
| Blockchain Integration | Story Protocol (IP), Karma.xyz (grants) via NEAR abstraction |
| TEE Architecture | Trusted execution environment ensuring computation integrity |
